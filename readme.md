This workshop is an implementation of different sorting algorithms.

We compared performances of five sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Quick sort,and Merge sort) in the following degrees.
1) Relationship between sorting time and data volume;
2) Relationship between sorting time and data sortness;
3) Relationship between memory consumption and data volume;
4) Relationship between memory consumption and data sortness.

The performances are in "array-Sorting/Simulation of sorting techniques/graphs/". There are four different data sets in four different folders.
